# Welcome to My Java Projects! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of Java projects I developed during my Introduction to Computer Science course. Each project explores fundamental programming concepts, ranging from basic syntax and logic to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and GUI development with Swing. Here's a quick overview of the projects, which will be fully revised and added over the next couple of weeks with the intention of mastering the subtle programming concepts each one focuses on:

- **Project 1 - Name Tag**: A Swing-based application displaying images in a `JFrame`, with console-based ASCII art.
- **Project 2 - Rectangles**: Working with geometric shapes and basic computations.
- **Project 3 - Bank Account**: Simulating a bank account with basic transactions.
- **Project 5 - Car Doors**: Modeling a car with door-related functionality.
- **Project 6 - Loop the Loop**: Practicing loops for iterative tasks.
- **Project 7 - House and Map**: Exploring data structures like maps in a house context.
- **Project 9 - Inheritance Gone Viral**: Diving into inheritance and object-oriented design.
- **Project 10 - Lights Out**: A fun project experimenting with logic and state changes.
